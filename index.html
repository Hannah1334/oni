<b>Name:</b> Shuten-doji<br>
<b>Alias:</b> Shuten<br>
<b>Title(s):</b> Silver<br>
<b>Race:</b> Oni, Class → <u>MAG:E</u> (Magically Augmented Generation: Electric)<br>
<b>True Age:</b> Forty-Three<br>
<b>Appearing Age:</b> Twenty-One<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Cis-Female<br>
<b>Build:</b> Toned, Athletic<br>
<b>Hair:</b> Silver<br>
<b>Horns:</b> Light Blue<br>
<b>Skin:</b> Pale Grey<br>
<b>Eyes:</b> Bi-colored, Neon Blue & Pink<br>
<b>Height:</b> 5’4”<br>
<b>Weight:</b> 130 lbs.<br><br>
<b>Appearance:</b><br>
The majority of Shuten’s attributes are fairly average when compared to most humanoid females; she possesses a visible hourglass figure and curves in the typical places (chest, rear, thighs) but some unique characteristics can also be pinpointed on her person. Two short and slightly curved horns naturally protrude from the temples of her head, they are normally a pale blue crystal color--nearly translucent, in fact, possessing a milky quality often found in crystals--but can glow a brighter version of their natural hue when specific racials or abilities are active.
<br><br>
Her facial features are softer than the rest of her figure by contrast. While hard muscle can be witnessed against toned flesh, the Oni’s heart-shaped head instead seems to favor soft rounded cheeks, gentle curves in her ever-so-slightly upturned nose, rosy lips, and symmetrical eyes. There is the smallest of points gathered at the top of the youth’s ears, inherited by ancestral Oni, but the most prominent of inhuman facial traits reside among her teeth and bi-colored gaze. Shuten possesses prominent upper fangs which are sharper and slightly longer than the rest of her chompers, especially visible when opening her mouth for any reason. Even more noticeable are her unique irises, which have to do with her race. She appears to have two rings in each eye as opposed to a normal human’s single circle of color. 
<br><br>
<b>Personality:</b><br>
“Ambitious” is a valid term to describe a majority of her decisions and motives. Shuten-doji wants to become Ibaraki-doji more than anything, but such a promotion is not only extremely rare but also one of the hardest paths an Oni can walk. Proud of her heritage as she might be, Shuten is also realistic and understands that she will have to work hard to make her dreams into reality. Being prepared to do whatever it takes can often result in some backlash, however, especially when considering how selfish her long term goal truly is. She may be overbearingly loyal to the customs of her people, but that “loyalty” doesn’t carry into many other things … if anything at all.

In times long since passed all of Oni-kind could be accurately lumped into one common stereotype. They were near-mindless brutes with limited sentience. Whatever wants they had were driven entirely by their base needs, and while the creatures were often massive dangerous fiends who favored violence, they were easily tricked or trapped by any smarter foe. As the years went by their offspring began to adapt to the world around them in both a physical and mental sense. Self awareness enlightened these pitiful creatures to the fact that they were on the very bottom of the yōkai hierarchy, leading to a split in their own “society.” An ambitious few Oni were angered into action, swearing that they’d rise through the ranks and become a notable race of beings, terrifying enough to strike fear into the hearts of any living thing. Project MAG was officially founded.
<br><br>
Determination beget an impressive amount of dedication to experimentation with genetics. This was accomplished by selective breeding. All Oni involved in this endeavour agreed to have children with other races and raise them to continue MAG, resulting in the “perfect” racials of their choice for future offspring; a mindset which still exists in their culture today, however the focus has drastically changed. Instead of simply gathering DNA for racials specifically, current MAG Class Oni keep greedy eyes out for unique forms of magic with the intention of adding an affinity for that practice into their gene-pool.
<br><br>
This particular lifestyle has drastically adapted the culture of MAG Oni. All are expected to contribute to their peoples’ collective goal, failure to do so devalue’s the worth of an individual’s life and makes them expendable. It is custom for them to spread out across the worlds (or multiverse) in search of potential useful additions to their genetics as well as make names for themselves. Multiple Oni cannot occupy the same space or profession (within the same area/region). All children are born under the name “Shuten-doji,” but can earn the honorable leadership name of “Ibaraki-doji” if they prove to be an invaluable asset to the MAG project.
<br><br>
Silver Shuten is one such Oni, from sector MAG:E. She was born to an Oni mother and raised under MAG’s system, completely devoted to its cause. The way of Shinobi was passed down from mother to daughter, influencing her fighting styles, mannerisms, and choice of career. Starting out as a Bounty Hunter, she made enough of a name for herself to be noticed by a guild called Chiokini. Making it into their ranks was part of Shuten’s plan from the start, so naturally the youth accepted. Choosing a dangerous “underground” line of work had been part of her strategy; not only would she receive more training and have plenty of opportunities to put it into practice, but she’d catch wind of any other MAG Oni daring to follow in her footsteps and usurp her from the guild’s ranks long before they’d have the chance. In her mind the setup was perfect, and from there it only got better.
<br><br>
Chiokini’s head honcho was soon revealed to be playing favorites between their members. Most of her comrades were angered by this--understandably--but Shuten saw only an opportunity to get ahead. She worked hard to appear trustworthy, loyal, and completely impartial to preferential treatment, preaching the honest belief that their leader earned such a position and could do whatever they pleased with that power. This continued until the Oni got exactly what she wanted out of her own behavior: assigned to a special mission with the presumed “favorite.” Now Shuten roams the land with Karahashi Norinobu and former member Takosenshi Moya on a quest to apparently kill a god. An outlandish and seemingly impossible goal, but one that she’s more than willing to try. Surely such a feat would earn her the Ibaraki promotion she lusts after, and even if it turns out to be nothing more than a child’s dream then she is prepared to aid Nori in silencing their tentacled companion once and for all.

Some examples of others are MAG:Fi (“mog-fie”) whose members are pyromancers, MAG:Ea (“mog-ayyyy”) whose members are geomancers, and MAG:Wa (“mog-wau”) which contains aquamancers. There are many with similar naming conventions. </li>
<br>
<li>One of the first true Ibaraki-doji still lives, they founded a unique sector known as MAG:Tra (“mog-trah”) which is a special breed of magic involving Transmutation. This particular Ibaraki uses their craft to create living organisms from any DNA collected which can successfully impregnate MAG Oni females through implantation, allowing selective breeding to overcome gender boundaries. </li>
<br>
<li>MAG Oni are permitted to cross paths and be friendly with one another, but if they desire to take up residence in the same place as another (“place” varies based on individual situations, it can be a neighborhood, town, kingdom, etc) then a test of strength occurs. They must vie for the right to take up space in that place by fighting to the death, to the victor goes the spoils. </li>
<br>
<li>Since MAG Oni have only two possible “true names” they are open to earning nicknames and titles. They will always be legally known as either Shuten-doji or Ibaraki-doji, but appreciate other namesakes given to them through relationships with others and/or earned from their careers. </li>
<br>
<li>A Female MAG Oni can either apply to be impregnated with test-fetuses developed by MAG:Tra or retrieve her own DNA. Impregnated women temporarily take up residence in nursery communities run by men, and are expected to raise their children (with the help of the community leaders--those aforementioned men) until the offspring are “of age,” ready to leave home and make their own way. Parents are permitted to give their child a “title” to aid in distinguishing them from the masses as their own. </li>

<div id="tab13">
<b>Aging</b><br>
The way Shuten’s people grow and age is similar--and pretty comparable to--how humans develop physically. However, it takes longer for a MAG Class Oni to age; for every one human year it takes them two. This gives them a much longer lifespan than that of an average mortal’s (anywhere between 140-180 years), and provides more time for physical and mental development during an Oni’s peak. They retain more, and can train muscle memory with precise practice, thanks to the slow progression of their bodies and minds.
<br><br>
<b>Skeleton Conduit</b><br>
<u>PROS</u> → A MAG:E Oni’s bones (horns, teeth and finger/toenails included) possess fibers that are metal-like in nature; an evolutionary trait that allows them to conduct electrical energy with incredible finesse through their own bodies without damaging them internally. (tl;dr their bones kinda act like power cables) These aforementioned fibers also reinforce the strength and structure of their skeleton overall, making it much stronger and harder to break.
<br>
<u>CONS</u> → Should a fracture or break occur, not only will the natural healing process take twice as long (or twice as much magic when healers are added to the equation), but the area of breakage will be dangerous to pass electricity through as its conduit function will be compromised. 
<br><br>
<b>Lightning Rod(s)</b><br>
<u>PROS</u> → Body heat can be channeled into one or both of Shuten’s horns. This causes them to glow and “activate” their special purpose as lightning rods. This is useful in the presence of storms, allowing herself to become a sentient target for lightning so that it can be processed through her Skeleton Conduit and repurposed into spells/techniques.
<br>
<u>CONS</u> → Each horn has its own individual body heat cost to become a successful Lightning Rod, one can be used without the other but will result in less control than if both are employed. In situations where she doesn’t have excess body heat to spare using this ability will make her very susceptible to cold and hypothermia.
<br><br>
<b>Bi-colored Vision</b><br>
<u>PROS</u> → Shuten technically has two irises in each eye, as opposed to one, and they do function in a unique way. In their passive “normal” state, when the inner ring is neon blue and its outer counterpart is pink, she has fairly plain vision about the same as the average human’s except for one simple perk: Darkvision. Her eyes can adjust over the course of a few seconds to see up to fifty feet away in environments with dim or nearly nonexistent lighting. Should the colors of each ring be swapped, however, with the inner iris being neon pink and the outer shifting to blue, a new form of sight is engaged: Spiritvision. Spiritvision allows one to perceive their surroundings from the point-of-view of the Spirit World, giving them the ability to spot the ethereal and some other things such as otherwise “invisible” energies.
<br>
<u>CONS</u> → Adjusting in and out of Darkvision takes time, causing her eyes to be sensitive to sudden and extreme changes in lighting. Additionally upkeeping Spiritvision requires focus and concentration, the breaking of which will immediately revert her eyes back to their “normal” state. Continuous use of Spiritvision over long extended periods of time will lead to intense migraines thanks to the strain on her eyes.
<br><br>
<b>Carnivore</b><br>
<u>PROS</u> → Shuten’s stomach is designed to healthily break down meats, no matter how “fresh” (see: raw) or well-cooked they are, regardless of what creature they come from. Oni can be cannibals! Parasites and illnesses specifically attributed to raw flesh cannot survive in the environment of an Oni’s stomach, protecting them from the negative effects of eating their kills fresh.
<br>
<u>CONS</u> → Any Oni can enjoy the taste of fruits and vegetables, but cannot gain nutrients from their consumption. In order to maintain a healthy diet their meals <b>must</b> contain meat and/or meat products.
<br><br>
<b>Real Recognize Real</b><br>
<u>PROS</u> → When a body part is removed, if it’s still in near-whole condition and can be retrieved, then tying it back onto its proper place and maintaining continuous contact in the location of disfigurement will allow the parts to slowly reattach. This process is sped up a considerable amount if the Oni is sleeping while the body recovers.
<br>
<u>CONS</u> → This ability does not apply to--and has no effect on--severments or removals that would typically kill someone instantly. I.E.: Decapitation and/or the removal of vital organs.
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Speed</b><br>
The physical prowess of any MAG Oni depends entirely on which sector they are born into. Those among MAG:E are blessed with the speed of their body and mind. They can maintain higher movement speeds than the average humanoid (x2), as well as mental processing speed and reactionary speed (also x2). This can be increased further within their lifespans, over time, when undergoing harsh training that’s meant to push their limits. 
<br><br>
<b>Dominant Gene</b><br>
All offspring born of Oni are also Oni. They have no half breeds, only further adapted and evolved generations. A child can--and most likely will--possess many of their “lesser parent’s” traits, but will still be entirely an Oni themself.

<p align="center"><i>In popular media a common trend for mages is the application of mediums, whether it be through staff, tome, or even crystal ball. While Shuten herself is no exception to this trend her method of spellcasting is arguably different. She employs the use of hand signs, combinations of which trigger a specific spell within her toolkit. There are three precise gestures she knows: Ten, Rai, and Chi.</i></p>
<br>
<b>Rai-Chi</b><br>
A spell which creates an aura of intense static electricity over the caster’s body. Its primary function is to allow a magnetic-like attraction between them and hard surfaces, basically making it so they can climb walls, stick to ceilings, or even get a sturdier grip on the ground underfoot. While this static “suit” doesn’t act like armor and can’t offer any real defense against solid objects or physical force it does make physical contact with the caster a rather painful experience. Additionally she can sacrifice the entire aura into a single highly concentrated zap of destructive electrical energy, if in direct contact with a metal object or substance. Doing so requires her to have a premeditated target for where the zap ends up (that would also have to be in contact with the object/material in question) and the electrical current can’t travel further than 40 feet away from her at the most.
<br><br>
<b>Rai-Ten-Chi</b><br>
A fairly simple spell in concept, one which briefly converts the caster’s body into condensed electrical energy and shoots them as a bolt of lightning to a new location. There are some specific conditions for this to work, however. To start, it isn’t able to be used willy-nilly, a premeditated target must be chosen as the goal or “location” she wishes to end up. Said target must either be metal or contain metal materials, within the caster’s line of sight (so not hidden behind a wall, by magic, too far and/or too small to see, etc) and cannot be further than 50 feet away at the very most. This spell isn’t intended to be used in quick succession as it can be very draining, unless some further special requirements are met (variable in another spell meant to synergize with this one) it’ll need a short window of one to two minutes for cooling down before it can be used again. 
<br><br>
<b>Rai-Chi-Ten</b><br>
This mudra is intended for use in tandem with <b>Rai-Ten-Chi</b>, but must be cast after <b>Rai-Ten-Chi</b> has been activated at least once in order for the spell to take effect. Should traveling like a lightning bolt to a metal target be a successful endeavour then this spell will leave behind a trail of sorts, connecting where the caster once was and where they are now with an electrical field. It’d be very easy to see with the naked eye (visual effects of snapping electricity), and only measures about 10 feet high, but its purpose is to damage and numb nerve endings and muscles of those who come into direct contact with the field. How far it stretches depends on the caster’s distance of zap-traveling, but it cannot exceed 20 feet in length. The field loses activity if the caster deactivates it, ports yet again to a new destination, or its tethered points are destroyed. However, as long as it maintains activity she will be able to use <b>Rai-Ten-Chi</b> freely between its tethered points without needing to worry about the cooldown. 
<br><br>
<b>Ten-Rai</b><br>
When completing the mudra for activating this spell the caster unlocks the ability to form beads of plasma at her fingertips (a possible one for every finger, not counting thumbs, for a total of 8) that are rather small, only about an inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. They’re intended to be fast moving projectiles that burn or melt through tough materials, sacrificing size for speed and concentrated heat. If two or less are used at a time they can fly at incredibly fast speeds up to 50 feet away, but if any more than that are employed at the same time their possible distance drops to about 30 feet. In situations where these “plasma bullets” miss their targets and continue flying off they just dissipate from existence altogether when exceeding their distance limit.
<br><br>
<b>Rai-Ten</b><br>
This spell allows the caster to form square-shaped panes of plasma, acting as protective barriers of sorts that are intended to burn/melt through substances that make contact with them as opposed to being solid shields standing against brute force. They are bright but not damaging to the eyes when looking at them, and translucent to a degree, not doing much to hide whatever waits on the other side. If only one or two are created at once the caster can manipulate their position and location by telepathically moving them around, of course this is limited to a 15 foot radius in her immediate area. If any more than that are created at once (she can have up to four) then they remain stationary where they’re formed and can continue existing so long as they’re not destroyed or the caster doesn’t get further than 30 feet from them. Each individual pane may vary in size, but its shape remains the same and none of them can ever measure more than 10x10 feet. 
<br><br>
<b>Chi-Ten</b><br>
A magical construct composed of electromancy mana that manifests as a 10 foot long electric chain. While the caster can hold and manipulate it physically without experiencing any damaging effects (unless of course she smacked herself with it hard, chains hurt) others who come in direct contact with the magical object will be exposed to high voltage electrical shots jolting through their body. When striking flammable materials it will ignite natural flame (fire that behaves normally and isn’t magical). When contested by sharp objects or other things with the intent of breaking it, this construct behaves like any other thick sturdy metal chain.
<br><br>
<b>Ten-Rai-Chi</b><br>
When completing this mudra the caster can expel air from their lungs as if emitting a heavy breath or sigh. This intentional blowing will produce a grey smog that’s statically charged and smells of gross burnt things like hair and flesh. Breathing in the stench isn’t necessarily harmful (unless you’re squeamish) but being inside the smog will impair sight (to a minor degree, just as much as smoke from a fire makes it hard to see). Additionally, enemies inside the static mist will experience a negative form of “shock therapy” in the form of a movement debuff, causing their muscles to stiffen more and more the longer they stay inside. Allies that remain within the mist will receive the opposite effect and maintain a small speed buff while in its vicinity. The area of effect for this spell increases over the course of three turns, starting at a 10 foot diameter, growing to 20 on the second turn, and 30 on the third, staying that way until deactivated or forcibly dispersed.
<br><br>
<b>Ten-Chi-Rai</b><br>
A basic spell that simply creates a storm cloud full of electrical energy which bursts into a controlled explosion. While it does send sparks flying everywhere it’s actually not all that harmful, favoring explosive force over burning with zaps. First a thick dark grey storm cloud forms, then when the caster wills it to burst it makes a loud explosion filled with electrical snapping sounds, spreading cloud-mist and debris every which way. The force of the explosion is enough to push or knockback the average sized person a couple of feet, but not much else. At a base it’s meant more as a distraction or cover than a spell meant to bring real harm. However, it has another method of use. If activated in tandem with some of Shuten’s other spells, the ones that create constructs (<b>Ten-Rai</b>, <b>Rai-Ten</b>, <b>Chi-Ten</b>), then instead of forming a storm cloud at all this spell simply allows the caster to blow up her own constructs. When this occurs the physical force of the blast remains the same, but the electricity bursting out becomes very dangerous and damaging. Regardless of the mode the blast radius of this spell is roughly 15 feet.
<br><br>
<b>Ten-Chi</b><br>
A spell that has no real use on its own and is only meant as a “buff” for Shuten’s other magic abilities. It allows her to use natural electricity in her environment (like during a thunderstorm) instead of just creating some herself. Doing this reduces some strain on her mana, allowing her to conserve a bit more, while also adding to the powerful bite of her electrical attacks.
<br><br>
<b>Chi-Rai</b><br>
A spell that has no real use on its own and is only meant as a “buff” for Shuten’s other magic abilities. When in very moist or wet environments the speed of her spells increase (by 25%) as well as the distance they can exist away from her (by 10 feet).

</div>

<div id="tab21">
<b>Hannya Mask</b><br>
A metallic piece of gear meant to cover the mouth, nose, and chin. Its design is meant to mimic the maw of traditional “Oni” in appearance, though if one looked close enough between the gaps of flashy teeth they’d find a shiny mesh screen. When functioning properly visible components will glow bright neon colors (pink and blue), but if malfunctioning, or its abilities aren’t in use, then it remains a lightless dull grey.
<br>
<u>PROS</u> → The Hannya Mask is enchanted with magics that provide it with a very special ability: filtering airborne toxins such as gasses, spores, mists, etc, allowing its wearer to continue breathing clean air. Harmful substances are stored within the mask and can be expunged into a deadly cloud whenever the wearer chooses, while breathing out or blowing. 
<br>
<u>CONS</u> → Occasional cleaning and generalized maintenance is required to keep this piece functioning properly, if not taken care of it will not be reliable. Additionally it can only absorb up to two magical toxins at once (this is specifically in reference to poisons and that sort of stuff created by other people’s/characters’ powers, not places or situations that “naturally” possess magical traits) any more than that will overload it.
<br><br>
<b>Electromagnetic Gauntlet</b><br>
Unique in design and application, this gauntlet is a combination of fabric and metal materials molded specifically for Silver Shuten-doji’s right hand and arm, covering the majority of her flesh, ending roughly three inches above her elbow. It’s a very tight fit and intended to look like a prosthetic despite just being a glove. These characteristics allow the piece of equipment to remain lightweight and aid her movement rather than impede it. A coming-of-age gift from her mother. 
<br>
<u>PROS</u> → Its protective metal plating is incredibly firm, allowing the glove to behave like a true piece of some very strong armor. Arguably the most important tool in her kit, Shuten’s gauntlet actually possesses three unique enchanted abilities. “Supercharge” is a spell that funnels electrical magic channeled through the glove back into her body, more specifically it zaps her right arm’s muscles and nerves, stimulating them in exchange for very high performance. This allows for extremely fast movements that appear as an indistinguishable blur to the naked eye. “Recall” engages an electromagnetic spell that creates a magnetic pull between her glove and weapon of her choice, allowing Shuten to recover her own tools if discarded, thrown, or knocked away. Finally, “Medium” is a mode which allows the activation of spells through metallic objects her gauntlet has come in direct contact with recently, allowing her to cast spells from a distance if certain conditions are met. 
<br>
<u>CONS</u> → Each of the Electromagnetic Gauntlet’s abilities can be active at the same time, but they must be engaged individually. She can’t access all three out of the blue immediately, first one, then another later, then another, as if she were layering. That being said each individual mode drains a hefty amount of mana and having all three active for extended periods of time can lead to burning herself out very fast. “Supercharge” can lead to overexertion of her muscles if not managed carefully, and can even cause some significant muscle damage. It’s also important to note that her arm is the <b>only</b> part of her body affected by this intense buff, creating a dangerous disconnect from the rest of her being. “Recall” only functions when applied to metal objects she maintained direct contact with if said contact was made within five minutes of the ability’s attempted use. For “Medium” to work items cannot be further than 20 feet away from Shuten. 
<br><br>
<b>Shinobi Tabi</b><br>
A pair of shoes crafted in traditional Eastern “two-toe” aesthetic, composed of sturdy fabrics, leather, rubbery materials, thin metal plates, and magic. Not much to look at, they’re a dark grey in color and don’t possess any fancy designs or visual effects. 
<br>
<u>PROS</u> → The “metal plates” are thin and located between layers of the sole, existing only to allow extra conduits for channeling her magic. Their minor enchanted traits are: an aide to help prolong the life of the shoes so wear-and-tear won’t have nearly as fast an effect, and inflammability to protect them from the volatile energies of Shuten’s magic. These Tabi are intended to be an important part of any Shinobi’s kit, however. The main function they possess allows the wearer to move around any terrain in absolute silence.
<br>
<u>CONS</u> → Shinobi Tabi’s primary enchantment only works if two very specific requirements are met. The wearer must be legitimately intending to sneak around, and other sentient beings within their vicinity (that they’re trying to sneak around specifically, doesn’t count for people they’re NOT trying to hide from at all) cannot be aware of their presence. On the chance that one or both of these conditions are not met then their stealth aspect will be null.
<br><br>
<b>Magnetic Shuriken</b><br>
Basic six-pointed throwing stars, and there are always six of them on her person, kept safely in their own special leather sleeves beneath her clothing. They are all made of very sturdy metals that are naturally magnetic. Each point is sharpened meticulously to a dangerous degree, clearly intended to be used in real combat. 
<br>
<u>PROS</u> → The magical augments of her Magnetic Shuriken are intended to buff already existing traits. One aspect allows them to slice through--or dig into--surfaces and materials they’d be unable to normally. Their second aspect causes them to favor metal, allowing them to curve their flightpath or even “follow” targets with metal on their person (sort of akin to the behavior of a homing missile) with disturbing accuracy, sticking like glue if they manage to reach their goal.
<br>
<u>CONS</u> → The shorter their distance of travel the stronger their piercing power making them only really useful for doing real damage in moderate ranges (10-20 feet). Additionally the further they get from Shuten the weaker their “homing” ability becomes, eventually losing precise tracking altogether (limited to about 40 feet before this aspect fades).
<br><br>
<b>Raijin’s Kunai</b><br>
Typically sheathed on either side of Shuten’s hips are a pair of matching Kunai. They’re classic in style, three pronged silver blades with the longest in the center, protruding from a black leather-bound hilt. From blade tip to hilt base they’re roughly 16 inches in length (or around 40 centimeters) and are constructed of a smooth steel. Both pieces have arcane traits, but their enhanced qualities are only accessible when the Oni channels her special electromancy magic through them. Otherwise the duo behave like mundane weapons.
<br>
<u>PROS</u> → At any point the sharp tips of both blades can be connected by an electrical tether, which responds as normal electricity would if direct contact is made (I.E.: intense burning damage, traveling through one’s body in search of the ground, etc). Both Kunai are also magnetic to a degree and this aspect can be built upon. They can be given opposite charges to draw them together, or matching charges to force them apart. When this ability is utilized their magnetic pull becomes very powerful, able to move human-sized entities at very high speeds (when applicable). 
<br>
<u>CONS</u> → The electrical tether has no solidity or durability, it’s merely a line of pure energy running between points A and B, so it couldn’t be used like a rope or anything intended to hold weight. It can also only stretch out to be around 10 feet in length before the Kunai would be too far apart for its existence to continue. When first activating the magnetic charges in Raijin’s Kunai physical contact is required. It’s not necessary for changing the nature of those set charges, but in order for this manipulation to be successful over distances the space between Shuten and her weapon(s) cannot be more than 40 feet.
